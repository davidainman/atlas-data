We do not consider that the nouns of the non-possessible classes (which include plants, animals, etc) have access to the same constructions as the nouns of this class, since this is seen only in elicitation. However, we think that this points to this class being the most default-like or generic, so we have designated it as the default one. These nouns almost always enter into direct possession.
