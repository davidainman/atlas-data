However, nominal possessors are never exemplified in the grammar, and the assumption that this is the construction used for nominal possessors is reconstructed from two separate statements in the grammar: (1) If the pronominal possessor is plural, this has to be marked by a preceding plural pronoun followed by -k'i, e.g. 'our (du) fathers' = 1.du.-k'i 1-father -- this says that a preceding element that is -k'i marked can be used alongside the pronominal prefix; (2) the grammar states that noun possessors are take a -k'i suffix (but does not indicate in alienable vs. inalienable constructions).
